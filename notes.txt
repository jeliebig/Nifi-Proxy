Broadcast packets on channel 11
  iw wlan0mon set channel 11
channel changed but stays the same during broadcast?

  Data:
    Beacon frame
    Data

Beacon frame:
  Differences:
    timestamp
      2 types of timestamps:
        del test.timestamp
        del test[2].timestamp
    mac_timestamp
      del test.mac_timestamp
    frame check sequence
      del test[1].fcs
        this thing is the only thing that will be recalced - maybe I shouldn't delete the others then

replacing mac addr did not work
  replace it with normal mac?
  or spoof it and be the Nintendo
